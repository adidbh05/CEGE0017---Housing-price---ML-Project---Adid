# CEGE0017 – Housing Price Prediction (ML Project)

This repository contains my UCL third-year Machine Learning research project.

The project studies the trade-off between **predictive accuracy** and **interpretability** in house price prediction using London property data, with effective use in London Housing valuation and financial decision-making. Three modelling approaches are compared:

- Linear regression (interpretable baseline)
- Gradient boosting with SHAP explanations
- A large language model (LLM) providing price predictions and natural-language explanations

The focus is not only on model performance, but on how useful and reliable the explanations are in a real-world valuation context.

All analysis, modelling decisions, and interpretations are my own.  
AI tools are used only in an assistive role and are explicitly documented.
